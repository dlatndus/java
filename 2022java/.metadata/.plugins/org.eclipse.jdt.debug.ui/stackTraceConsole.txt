Hello, I'm going to start presenting my English performance of travel diary.

The travel destination I chose is the Uyuni Salt Desert.

The Uyuni salt desert looks like this. Isn't it so beautiful?

Before we go to the Uyuni Salt Desert, let me explain Bolivia where the Uyuni Desert is located.

This place belongs to the tropics, but since it is in the alpine zone, you may get alpine disease.


Therefore, it is recommended to prepare medicine to prevent alpine diseases and a jacket for the temperature difference.

Since let's go to the Uyuni salt desert.

You can go to Uyuni by plane or bus from La Paz, the capital of Bolivia.

There are no toilets around the desert, so it is essential to go to the bathroom in town before you go.

The Uyuni Salt Desert was originally a deep sea, but the ground rose due to crustal changes and became a huge lake after the ice age.

After a long period of time, the lake evaporated and became what it is today's salt plains.

Like Bolivia in the tropics, the Uyuni salt desert can be divided into rainy and dry seasons, but from November to March is the rainy season and is often seen in the media.

It's rainy season, so you can take beautiful pictures only when you go on a sunny day when the clouds float moderately right after it rains.

At this time, the Uyuni Salt Desert has a vague boundary between the sky and the earth, so I can see it for the first time and feel mysterious.

You can also take part in the Uyuni star Light Tour at night to see the Milky Way and a separate show in the Uyuni Salt Desert.

Actually, I secretly went here and dipped in salt, brought a frying pan, shrimp, and mackerel and grilled mackerel with salt

It was surprisingly delicious.

I don't know where it was before, but when I first saw the Uyuni salt desert,It was so amazing that I really wanted to go there.

But that became a reality, and I was able to take this opportunity to achieve my bucket list of my life.
